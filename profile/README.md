# The web is changing

[substructure.one](https://substructure.one) is working on tools to enable the 
next generation of web
technology. Data ownership, open source sustainability, and creator empowerment
are the themes driving the technology we develop.

## Kestrel

Kestrel is the next-gen platform for open source SaaS deployment. Open source
development has already driven the development of the most successful SaaS
products, but development trends are still skewed by the needs of a
traditional business model. True open source collaboration requires the ability
to fork, tweak, and redeploy seemlessly, but the need to monetize products
with traditional subscription models means even open source SaaS solutions are
developed to trap users and discourage innovation.

The Kestrel platform is designed to allow developers to create open source
flywheels that encourage forking, innovating, and repurposing, all while
maintaining incentive schemes that ensure innovators get properly compensated
for their contributions.

Kestrel is the main current focus at substructure.one
